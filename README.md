# Extraction
This project aims to build a classifier to predict the Pass/Fail yield of a particular process entity and analyze whether all the features are required to build the model or not.

We have used RandomForestClassifier, GaussianNB, RandomizedSearchCV, KFold, SMOTE, PCA, EDA.

It contains an Jupyter Notebook file(.ipynb) and an html file to view the code in any browser.
